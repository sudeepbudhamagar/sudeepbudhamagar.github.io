<h1>Terms of Use (End User License Agreement)</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 29, 2025</p>

<p><strong>App Name:</strong> Japanese N5-N1<br>
<strong>Developer:</strong> Sudeep Budha Magar (“we”, “us”, “our”)</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>
By downloading or using the Japanese N5-N1 application (“the App”), you agree to these Terms of Use (“EULA”). 
If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.
</p>

<h2>2. License Grant</h2>
<p>
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on your personal devices 
for non-commercial learning purposes.
</p>

<h2>3. Free Use, Advertisements, and Optional Subscription</h2>
<p>
The App is free to download and provides full access to all learning content, tests, and features without requiring payment. 
Free users may see in-app advertisements served by Google AdMob or other providers.
</p>

<p>
A monthly <strong>auto-renewable subscription</strong> (“Premium Subscription”) is available. This subscription:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removes all advertisements from the App</li>
  <li>Allows offline usage of the App after required data is downloaded</li>
</ul>

<p>
All educational content remains fully free for all users. The subscription only removes ads and enables offline functionality.
</p>

<h2>4. Offline Access</h2>
<p>
Free users require an internet connection to use the App because advertisements must be loaded and displayed online. 
Subscribed users do not receive ads and therefore may use the App offline once required data has been downloaded.
</p>

<p>
Offline mode does not unlock additional learning content; it only allows ad-free users to access the same content without internet connectivity.
</p>

<h2>5. Subscription Billing and Renewal</h2>
<p>
Payment for the Premium Subscription is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase. 
The subscription renews automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.
</p>

<p>
Your Apple ID account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours before the current period ends. 
You may manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID account settings.
</p>

<p>
We do not process or store payment information; all transactions are handled by Apple.
</p>

<h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>
All learning content, text, questions, explanations, graphics, and other materials in the App are protected by copyright 
and remain the exclusive property of the developer. You may not copy, redistribute, or use content outside the App 
without permission.
</p>

<h2>7. Prohibited Uses</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reverse engineering or attempting to extract the source code</li>
  <li>Copying or redistributing large portions of the content</li>
  <li>Using content to train competing products or AI systems</li>
  <li>Bypassing or interfering with ad delivery systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Termination</h2>
<p>
We may terminate or suspend access if you violate these Terms. 
You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it. 
Canceling the subscription must be done through Apple ID settings.
</p>

<h2>9. No Warranty</h2>
<p>
The App is provided “as is.” We make no warranties regarding:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uninterrupted or error-free function</li>
  <li>Guaranteed exam results</li>
  <li>Perfect alignment with official JLPT examinations</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, 
including academic results, lost data, or lost profit.
</p>

<p>
Our total liability will not exceed the amount paid (if any) for the Premium Subscription in the 12 months prior to the claim.
</p>

<h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>
We may update these Terms occasionally. Continued use of the App indicates acceptance of updated Terms.
</p>

<h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
<p>
These Terms are governed by the laws of Nepal. 
Any disputes shall be handled by the courts of Nepal unless otherwise required by applicable consumer protection law.
